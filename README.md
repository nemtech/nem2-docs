This documentation introduces NEM's next core engine (NEM2), code-named **Catapult**.

## NEM is Your Blockchain Engine

[NEM](https://nem.io) is a developer-friendly blockchain platform for businesses. It offers flexible and customizable solutions through simple, yet powerful, built-in features. 

Developers are able to integrate blockchain technology into their projects or create powerful dApps using NEM’s **REST API**. This allows creating a variety of architectural solutions with lightweight code in any language.

NEM provides access to both public and private blockchains, providing options to best suit your company’s needs. The public blockchain is a decentralized, open, and self-sustaining ledger that can be used by anyone. The private blockchain, on the other hand, offers higher speed and privacy.

## Catapult: Preview NEM’s next core engine

[Catapult](https://mijin.io/en/product/#mijin2) is NEM's next core engine. It is written in C++ and follows a 4-layered [architecture](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/node.html), aiming to make NEM more scalable. It builds upon the achievements of its previous iteration, adding the newest innovations in blockchain technology. 

Catapult introduce new exclusive features:

* [Aggregate Transactions](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/aggregate-transaction.html)
* [Cross-chain Swaps](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/cross-chain-swaps.html)
* [Multi-level Multisig Accounts](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/multisig-account.html#manufacturing-and-supply-chains)
* [Account Restrictions](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/account-restriction.html)
* [Mosaic Restrictions](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/mosaic-restriction.html)

Catapult will be a momentous step for NEM to be the widely utilized enterprise product it was envisioned to be. After nearly three years of development, the long-awaited update is expected to launch [in 2020](https://forum.nem.io/t/migration-committee-community-update-4/23847/3).
