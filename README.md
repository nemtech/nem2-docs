# NEM Developer Center

This documentation introduces [NEM](https://nem.io)'s next core engine (NEM2), code-named **Catapult**.

## Catapult is Your Blockchain Platform

Catapult is a developer-friendly blockchain platform for businesses.
It reduces cost, complexity, and time-to-market so businesses can be more competitive.
Catapult offers flexible and secure customizable solutions through simple, yet powerful, built-in features.

Developers are able to integrate blockchain technology into their projects or create powerful dApps using Catapult’s **REST API**.
This allows creating a variety of architectural solutions with lightweight code efficiently, in any programming language.

Catapult provides access to both public and private blockchains, individually or as a hybrid, providing options to best suit your company’s needs.
The public blockchain is a decentralized, open, and self-sustaining ledger that can be used by anyone.
The private blockchain, on the other hand, offers higher speed and privacy.
