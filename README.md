## Symbol is Your Blockchain Platform

Symbol is a developer-friendly blockchain platform for businesses.
It reduces cost, complexity, and time-to-market so businesses can be more competitive.

Symbol offers flexible and secure customizable solutions through simple, yet powerful, built-in features.
Developers are able to easily integrate blockchain technology into their projects or create powerful dApps using Symbol’s REST API.
This allows creating a variety of architectural solutions with lightweight code efficiently, in any programming language.

Symbol provides access to both public and private blockchains, individually or as a hybrid, providing options to best suit your company’s needs.
The public blockchain is a decentralized, open, and self-sustaining ledger that can be used by anyone.
The private blockchain, on the other hand, offers higher speed and privacy.
