Blocks
######

The central element of every cryptocurrency is a public ledger called the called blockchain, which links blocks together.

.. Each NEM block can contain up to ``N`` :doc:`transactions <transaction>`.

Since the blocks in the chain are ordered, the complete transaction history is held in the blockchain. Subsequent blocks in the blockchain have increasing heights that differ by one.

Blocks are stored on a database as permanent medium. NEM calls the first block in the chain the nemesis block.

NEM blocks complete every ``15`` seconds, making transactions confirm quickly enough for everyday use.

.. note:: Configuration parameters are `editable <https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server/blob/master/resources/config-network.properties>`_ . Public network configuration may differ.

**************
Block creation
**************

Blocks are created by accounts. The process of creating new blocks is called harvesting. The harvesting account - called the harvester - gets the fees for the transactions in the block. This gives the harvester an incentive to add as many transactions to the block as possible.

.. Any account that has a vested balance of at least N XEM is eligible to harvest.

**********
Parameters
**********

Blocks have the following properties:

    **Timestamp**

    The number of seconds elapsed since the creation of the nemesis block.

    **Previous block hash**

    The ``sha3-256`` hash of the last blockchain as an hexadecimal string.

    **Signature**

    The block signature. The signature was generated by the signer and can be used to validate that the block data was not modified by a node.

    **Type**

    The nemesis block has type -1. The rest of the blocks have type 1.

    **Transactions**

    The array of transaction included in the block.

    **Version**

    The block version. It can represent:

    * Main network
    * Test network
    * Mijin network
    * Mijin test network (Catapult)

    **Signer**

    The public key of the harvester of the block as a hexadecimal number.

    **Height**

    The height of the blockchain. Each blockchain has a unique height. Subsequent blocks differ in height by 1.
