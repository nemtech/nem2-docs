    Alice sends 10 |networkcurrency| to Bob

*********
Recipient
*********

The recipient is the address of the :doc:`account <account>` that receives the TransferTransaction.

It is possible to send mosaics to any valid address, even if the address has not previously participated in any transaction.

.. note:: If nobody owns the private key of the recipient's account, the funds are most likely lost forever.

*******
Mosaics
*******

A :doc:`mosaic <mosaic>` could be a token, but it could also be more specialized assets such as reward points, shares of stock, signatures, status flags, votes or even other currencies.

You can send a combination of different mosaics in the same transaction.

*******
Message
*******

In the :ref:`public network <config-network-properties>`, transfer transactions can hold a message up to ``1023`` characters in length, making them suitable for timestamping data permanently on the blockchain.

By default, the messages attached are visible by default to all network participants, although the client does not encrypt the message.

Encrypted message
=================

Encrypted messages are only accessible by the sender and the recipient.

|codename| uses Bouncy Castle's AES block cipher implementation in `CBC mode <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC>`_ to encrypt and decrypt messages.

.. note:: You can find under the ``crypto`` module how to `encode <https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-sdk-typescript-javascript/blob/master/src/core/crypto/Crypto.ts#L248>`_ and `decode <https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-sdk-typescript-javascript/blob/master/src/core/crypto/Crypto.ts#L316>`_ encrypted messages, but we recommend you to use the available `SDK public methods <https://nemtech.github.io/nem2-sdk-typescript-javascript/classes/_model_account_account_.account.html#decryptmessage>`_ instead.
