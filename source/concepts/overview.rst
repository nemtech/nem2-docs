Aggregate Transaction
=====================

A type of transaction that merges multiple transactions into one by generating a one-time disposable smart contract. 

:doc:`Read more ...<aggregate-transaction>`.

Cross-Chain Swap
================

A built-in feature of Symbol which enables the trading of tokens across different blockchains without using an intermediary party (e.g. an exchange service).

Multisig Account
================

Accounts that require additional signatures (from cosignatories) to initiate actions/transfers.

:doc:`Read more ...<multisig-account>`.

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

Mosaics
=======

Digital tokens on the Symbol blockchain used to represent fixed assets - set of multiple identical things that do not change. 

:doc:`Read more ...<mosaic>`.

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

Restrictions
============

A feature that allows mosaic creators to control which accounts can transact with the asset. It only affects mosaics with the restrictable property enabled explicitly at the moment of creation.

:doc:`Read more ...<mosaic-restriction>`.

    <hr>

Namespaces
==========

Unique domain spaces on the Symbol blockchain, which can be linked to Symbol accounts or mosaics. Functions similarly to internet domains.

Metadata
========

Additional information that can be attached to accounts or mosaics.

Inflation
=========

Assets created on the Symbol blockchain can set an inflation configuration to increase the supply per block.

Extending Symbol
================

The plugin approach allows developers to introduce different ways to alter the chain's state via transactions without modifying the core engine or disrupting other features.
