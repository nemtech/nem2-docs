#################
Creating a mosaic
#################

Tokenize an asset using mosaics.

**********
Background
**********

A private company, ComfyClothingCompany, decides that it wants to go public. Instead of a traditional IPO, the company decides to do an STO to issue tokens through the NEM platform.

In this guide, we are going to help this company to **create the tokens for their STO** using :doc:`mosaics <../../concepts/mosaic>` built-in feature and the NEM2-SDK.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

- Finish the :doc:`getting started section <../../getting-started/setup-workstation>`
- Have one :ref:`account with cat.currency <setup-getting-a-test-account>`

**********************
Getting into some code
**********************

1. Before starting this guide, make sure you have an :doc:`account loaded with cat.currency  <../../getting-started/setup-workstation>`.

2. Then, the company must create a mosaic to represent shares to their company. To do so, you will have to create a new file and define two transactions:

a. A :ref:`MosaicDefinitionTransaction <mosaic-definition-transaction>` to select the **mosaic properties**. In this example, we are going to create a mosaic configured as:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Property", "Value", "Description"
    :delim: ;

    Divisibility; 0 ; Although brokerages and investment firms can fractionalize shares, the traditional minimum number of shares an investor can purchase from the open market is 1.
    Duration; 0; Shares of the company should exist as long as the company is in business. The ComfyClothingCompany sets this property to ``0``, creating a non-expiring mosaic.
    Supply mutable; True; ComfyClothingCompany sets the initial supply of the mosaic to a typical startup amount of ``10,000,000`` authorized shares. As the company grows, it could choose to increase the number of shares, so the supply mutable is set to ``true``.
    Transferable; True; Once the initial shares are distributed, the shares will be on the market to be traded in public. Thus, the transferability property needs to be set to ``true``.
    Restrictable; True; Since STOs are regulated, the mosaic owner should be able to restrict which accounts can transact with the mosaic.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

b. A :ref:`MosaicSupplyChangeTransaction <mosaic-supply-change-transaction>`, to set the **initial supply**. We are going to create **1.000.000** mosaic units.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

NEM mainly works with **absolute amounts**. To get an absolute amount, multiply the amount of assets you want to create by 10\ :sup:`divisibility`.  For example, if the mosaic has **divisibility** 2, to create 10 units (relative) you should define 1000 (absolute) instead.

3. Announce both transactions together using an :ref:`AggregateTransaction <aggregate-transaction>`.

.. note:: To make the transaction only valid for your network, include the first block generation hash. Open ``http://localhost:3000/block/1`` in a new tab and copy the ``meta.generationHash`` value.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 03 */
        :end-before: /* end block 03 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 03 */
        :end-before: /* end block 03 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/bash/mosaic/CreatingAMosaic.sh
        :language: bash
        :start-after: #!/bin/sh

Once the transaction gets confirmed, you can try to :doc:`transfer <../transaction/sending-a-transfer-transaction>` one mosaic created to another account, :doc:`modify the mosaic properties <modifying-mosaic-supply>` or :doc:`link a namespace to the mosaic <creating-a-mosaic>`.
