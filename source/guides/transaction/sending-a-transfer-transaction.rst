    Sending a transfer Transaction

Alice wants to send 10 XEM to Bob, whose address is ``SD5DT3-CH4BLA-BL5HIM-EKP2TA-PUKF4N-Y3L5HR-IR54``.

**Monitoring the transaction**

Once an account announces a transaction, the server will always return an OK response. Receiving an OK response does not mean the transaction is valid. A good practice is to monitor transactions before being announced.

To understand the transaction lifecycle, we recommend you to open three new terminals. The first terminal :doc:`monitors announced transactions<../transaction/monitoring-a-transaction-status>` validation errors.

.. code-block:: bash

    $> nem2-cli monitor status

Monitoring ``unconfirmed`` shows you which transactions have reached the network, but not are not included in a block yet.

.. code-block:: bash

    $> nem2-cli monitor unconfirmed

Once a transaction is included, you will see it under the ``confirmed`` terminal.

.. code-block:: bash

    $> nem2-cli monitor confirmed

************************
Letâ€™s get into some code
************************

Alice wants sends ``10 XEM`` to Bob. She wants to include a message, for example ``Welcome to NEM``.

1. Create the transfer transaction, by including Bob address as the recipient, adding 10 XEM and the message requested.

.. example-code::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.ts
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-ts|
        :language: typescript
        :lines:  31-38

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/java/src/test/java/nem2/guides/examples/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.java
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-java|
        :language: java
        :lines:  45-53

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.js
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-js|
        :language: javascript
        :lines:  31-38

Although the transaction is created, it has not been announced to the network yet. Alice must sign the transaction with her account first so that the network can verify its authenticity.

2. Sign the transaction with Alice account.

.. example-code::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.ts
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-ts|
        :language: typescript
        :lines:  41-45

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/java/src/test/java/nem2/guides/examples/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.java
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-java|
        :language: java
        :lines:  55-60

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.js
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-js|
        :language: javascript
        :lines:  41-45

3. Once signed, you can :doc:`announce the transaction <../../concepts/transaction>` to the network.

.. example-code::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.ts
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-ts|
        :language: typescript
        :lines:  48-

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/java/src/test/java/nem2/guides/examples/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.java
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-java|
        :language: java
        :lines:  63-66

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.js
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-js|
        :language: javascript
        :lines:  48-

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/cli/transaction/SendingATransferTransaction.sh
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-cli|
        :language: bash
        :start-after: #!/bin/sh

4. Open the terminal where you are monitoring account transactions ``status``. It should be empty. If there is an error, you can check :doc:`the error code here <../../api/status-errors>`.

A new transaction should have appeared in the terminal where you are monitoring ``unconfirmed``. At this point, the transaction has reached the network, but it is not clear if it will get included in a block.

If it is included in a block, the transaction gets processed, and the amount stated in the transaction gets transferred from the sender's account to the recipient's account.

Send multiple mosaics in the same transaction.

**Adding multiple mosaics**

    Sending multiple mosaics in the same transaction

As you may have noticed, transfer transactions require an array of mosaics as a parameter, allowing to send transfer transactions with multiple mosaics at the same time.

If you own more than one mosaic, send them together in the same transaction:

.. example-code::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingATransferTransactionWithMultipleMosaics.ts
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-with-multiple-mosaics-ts|

        :lines:  39-40

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/java/src/test/java/nem2/guides/examples/transaction/SendingATransferTransactionWithMultipleMosaics.java
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-with-multiple-mosaics-java|
        :language: java
        :lines:  54-57

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingATransferTransactionWithMultipleMosaics.js
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-with-multiple-mosaics-js|
        :language: javascript
        :lines:  38-39

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/cli/transaction/SendingATransferTransactionWithMultipleMosaics.sh
        :caption: |sending-a-transfer-transaction-with-multiple-mosaics-cli|
        :language: bash
        :start-after: #!/bin/sh
