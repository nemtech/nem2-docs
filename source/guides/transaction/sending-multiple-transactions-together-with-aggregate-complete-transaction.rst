######################################
Sending multiple transactions together
######################################

Send transactions to different accounts at the same time, using aggregate transactions.

**********
Background
**********

Dan wants to send mosaics to Alice and Bob. He could achieve this sending a couple of **TransferTransactions**.

However, to make sure Alice and Bob receive the funds at the same time, we are going to define an :ref:`AggregateTransaction <aggregate-transaction>`.

    Sending transactions to different recipients atomically

*************
Prerequisites
*************

- Finish :doc:`sending mosaics and messages between two accounts guide <sending-a-transfer-transaction>`
- Have one :ref:`account with cat.currency <setup-getting-a-test-account>`

**********************
Getting into some code
**********************

1. Open a new file, and define two :ref:`transfer transactions <transfer-transaction>` to send 10 cat.currency to different recipients.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

2. Wrap both transactions in an :ref:`AggregateTransaction <aggregate-transaction>`, adding Dan's public account as the required signer. As one private key — Dan's account — can sign all the transactions in the aggregate, we can define the transaction as *complete*.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

3. Sign and announce the transaction with Dan's account.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 03 */
        :end-before: /* end block 03 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 03 */
        :end-before: /* end block 03 */

What's next?

Send an AggregateBondedTransaction following :doc:`creating an escrow contract <creating-an-escrow-contract-with-aggregate-bonded-transaction>` guide.
