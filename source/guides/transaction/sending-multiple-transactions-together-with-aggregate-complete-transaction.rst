######################################
Sending multiple transactions together
######################################

Send transactions to different accounts atomically, using an :ref:`AggregateCompleteTransaction <aggregate-transaction>`.

**********
Background
**********

Dan wants to send mosaics to Alice and Bob. He chooses to send an AggregateCompleteTransaction, so both will receive the funds at the same time.

    Sending transactions to different recipients atomically

*************
Prerequisites
*************

- Finish :doc:`sending mosaics and messages between two accounts guide <sending-a-transfer-transaction>`
- Have one :ref:`account with cat.currency <setup-getting-a-test-account>`

**********************
Getting into some code
**********************

1. Create two :ref:`TransferTransaction <transfer-transaction>` with two different recipients, wrapping them in an :ref:`AggregateTransaction <aggregate-transaction>`.

As one private key can sign all the transactions in the aggregate, define the aggregate as *complete*. That means that there is no need to lock funds to send the transaction. If valid, it will be accepted by the network.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 01 */
        :end-before: /* end block 01 */

2. Sign and announce the transaction.

.. example-code::

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.ts
        :language: typescript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

    .. viewsource:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/transaction/SendingMultipleTransactionsTogetherWithAggregateCompleteTransaction.js
        :language: javascript
        :start-after:  /* start block 02 */
        :end-before: /* end block 02 */

************
What's next?
************

Send an AggregateBondedTransaction following :doc:`creating an escrow contract <creating-an-escrow-contract-with-aggregate-bonded-transaction>` guide.
