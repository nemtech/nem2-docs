"An account is a **key pair** (private and public key) associated with a "
"mutable state stored on the NEM blockchain. In other words, you have a "
"deposit box in the blockchain, which only you can modify with your key pair."
" As the name suggests, the private key has to be kept secret at all times. "
"Anyone with access to the private key, ultimately has control over the "
"account."
msgstr ""
"账户是一组NEM区块链上和可变状态有关的密钥对（私钥和公钥）。换句话说，有了账户就像有了一个在区块链上的存款箱。只有你可以以密钥对对其作出更改。顾名思义，密钥必须时刻保密。得到私钥就等同得到账户的拥有权。"

"Think about NEM accounts as a **container for assets** in the blockchain. An"
" account could represent a deposit of tokens, like most blockchains. "
"However, it could also represent a **single object** that must be unique and"
" updatable: a package to be shipped, a deed to a house or a document to be "
"notarized."
msgstr ""
"NEM账户是区块链上的 **资产容器**，像其他区块链的账户一样，可以代表存放着的代币。但同时，它也可以代表独特及可更新 "
