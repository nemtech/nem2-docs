"The :doc:`running-a-symbol-node` guide explains how to easily **create a "
"node using Symbol Bootstrap**. In that guide, the setup process is "
"conducted on the same machine that will host the node, meaning that "
"private keys are generated on a machine connected to the Internet. If you"
" need a **hardened level of security** you can follow this guide instead,"
" at the cost of a more involved setup process."

"The **summary** of it is that the ``symbol-bootstrap start`` command is "
"split into a ``config`` phase run offline, which generates a "
"configuration folder, and the rest of the ``start`` command is then run "
"on the destination online machine that will host the node. **The main "
"account's private key never leaves the offline machine**."
