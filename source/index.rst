Catapult is your Blockchain Platform
************************************

|codename| is a **developer-friendly blockchain platform** for businesses.
It reduces cost, complexity, and time-to-market so businesses can be more competitive.
|codename| offers flexible and secure customizable solutions through simple, yet powerful, built-in features.

Developers are able to easily integrate blockchain technology into their projects or create powerful dApps using |codename|'s :doc:`REST API <api>`.
This allows creating a variety of architectural solutions with lightweight code efficiently, in any programming language.

|codename| provides access to both **public and private blockchains**, individually or as a hybrid, providing options to best suit your company's needs.
The public blockchain is a decentralized, open, and self-sustaining ledger that can be used by anyone.
The private blockchain, on the other hand, offers higher speed and privacy.
