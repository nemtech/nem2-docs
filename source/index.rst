This documentation introduces NEM's next core engine (NEM2), code-named **Catapult**.

*****************************
NEM is Your Blockchain Engine
*****************************

|nem| is a **developer-friendly blockchain platform** for businesses. It offers flexible and customizable solutions through simple, yet powerful, built-in features.

Developers are able to integrate blockchain technology into their projects or create powerful dApps using NEM's :doc:`REST API <api>`. This allows creating a variety of architectural solutions with lightweight code in any language.

NEM provides access to both **public and private blockchains**, providing options to best suit your company's needs. The public blockchain is a decentralized, open, and self-sustaining ledger that can be used by anyone. The private blockchain, on the other hand, offers higher speed and privacy.

****************************************
Catapult: Preview NEMâ€™s next core engine
****************************************

|Catapult| is NEM's next core engine. It is written in C++ and follows a :doc:`4-layered architecture <concepts/node>`, aiming to make NEM more scalable. It builds upon the achievements of its previous iteration, adding the newest innovations in blockchain technology.

Catapult introduce new exclusive features:

* :doc:`Aggregate Transactions <concepts/aggregate-transaction>`
* :doc:`Cross-Chain Swaps <concepts/cross-chain-swaps>`
* :doc:`Multi-level Multisig Accounts <concepts/multisig-account>`
* :doc:`Account Restriction <concepts/account-restriction>`
* :doc:`Mosaic Restriction <concepts/mosaic-restriction>`

Catapult will be a momentous step for NEM to be the widely utilized enterprise product it was envisioned to be. After three years of development, the long-awaited update is expected to launch `in 2020 <https://forum.nem.io/t/migration-committee-community-update-4/23847/3>`_.
